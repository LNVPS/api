## Project File Memories
- Created file `./ADMIN_API_ENDPOINTS.md` to document administrative API endpoints for the project
- Created file `./API_DOCUMENTATION.md` to provide comprehensive API documentation for the project
- Prefer using map() and_then() over deeply nested if structures
- Always return amounts in api responses as cents / milli-sats
- Never add javascript code examples to api documents
